# How to get started

You have to download all python-files and install all modules from `requirements.txt`. Then you are ready to go.

`signal-processing.py` contains the functionality discussed in my thesis: Wilson's algorithm to sample spanning forests and thus representative vertices. It also provides the functionality of the signal processing and visualisation.

`main.py` provides you with some examples how you can use the implemented functions.

`non_reversible_graphs.py`, `square_graph.py` and as well `example_graphs.py` provide graphs on which you can apply the implemented functions.
